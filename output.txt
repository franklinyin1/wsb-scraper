Values in the secondary market declined 0.19%, down for a second month.\\nA slump in the home market is becoming more evident as developers including China Evergrande Group struggle to raise money and buyers stay away. Falling prices may fuel a vicious cycle by further weakening demand, worsening the cash shortage at builders and forcing them to offer bigger discounts.\\nSeptember is traditionally a peak season for the home market. Yet residential sales tumbled 17% by area, investments slid for the first time since early 2020, and the rate of failed land auctions climbed to the highest since at least 2018.\\nRead more on the impact of land auction flops\\nThe downturn has continued into this month. Existing-home sales plunged 63% from a year earlier in the first 17 days of October, according to a Nomura Holdings Inc. note Monday.\\n“The new-home market faces relatively big downward pressure in the short term,” Yang Kewei, a research director at China Real Estate Information Corp., said before the figures were released. “The effects of price discounts are waning.”\\nFears of contagion from the crisis at Evergrande have intensified after a surprise default by Fantasia Holdings Group Co. and a wave of credit rating downgrades at other developers. Yields on Chinese high-yield dollar bonds, which are dominated by builders, have climbed to their highest in about a decade, hurting a key funding channel for the sector.\\nThat will have a knock-on effect on the broader economy, since Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates the property sector and related downstream industries make up almost a quarter of gross domestic product.\\nStill, China’s central bank has said risks posed to the domestic economy by Evergrande can be contained. The property firm’s trouble “casts a little bit of concern,” People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said at a virtual meeting of the Group of 30 on Sunday.\"\n}""{\n  \"title\": \"Baby's first YOLO\",\n  \"postContent\": \"Good luck.

Well, I'm writing this post to use some of my gained credibility to voice my opinion on NET's short-term outlook. Cloudflare is releasing its earnings on November 4th; I believe that NET's bull run will likely continue up until the release of its earnings. I have a lot of conviction for NET's long-term growth and it is clear that the company currently has strong short-term momentum, but that does not mean that the crazy 50% run-up is necessarily justified. My prediction is that when the earnings are released, they will overtake last quarter's earnings, but will not justify the recent run-up thus causing the stock to dip. There hasn't really been too much of a clear catalyst for the recent run-up other than strong bullish indications due to the stock's strength when faced with a sharp decline/poor news.
